    "## Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts\n",
    "In the previous section, we talked about various actions we can do within a Jupyter Notebook. All of these actions required going to the Toolbar or the Menu at the top of the notebook. Doing this for every single action can be tiring, so luckily for us, there are a number of neat shortcuts to help us do the same actions.\n",

    "Some of these shortcuts require you to be in the Edit Mode or the Command Mode of a cell. Remember, you are in Edit Mode if you can see the pencil icon in the top right corner of the Menu. \n",

    "To activate command mode, press `Esc` and to activate Edit Mode, press `Enter`. \n",
